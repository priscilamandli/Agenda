![The page look like this](./public/page.jpeg "The page looks like this)

This is the first projects by my self. Consists in get some values, save them in the database and then, render them in cards.

If you want to **reuse my code** follow this steps:
1. Create a *project* and a *database* in [Firebase/Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/) .
2. Replace the values on the *firebase.js file* with the values of your *web app's Firebase configuration*.
**YouÂ´re ready to use it!**
