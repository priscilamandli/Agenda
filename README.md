## React + Firebase (Firestore)

![The page look like this](./public/page.jpeg)

This is the first project by myself. Consists of getting some values, saving them into the database followed by rendering them in cards.

If you want to **reuse my code** follow this steps:
1. Create a *project* and a *database* in [Firebase/Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/) .
2. Replace the values on the *firebase.js file* with the values of your *web app's Firebase configuration*.


**YouÂ´re ready to use it!**
